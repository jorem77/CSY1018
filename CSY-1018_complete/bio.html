<p>About me:</p>
</body>
To put it short I am a friendly, kind and happy person.The main activity that I do is play football and surf the web. From a young age I have enjoyed both football and surfing the web.I believe that playing football will keep me fit and healthy and surfing the web allows me to always find out new things that can really benefit me in my day to day life. This really does sum up for what I do on a day basis. Obviously this is not enough for someone to do on daily basis, so I have listed below some other activities that I do at times.
